Travel the cosmos with Qiskit Runtime
The nicely quoted problem statement for the challenge from the [IBM Blog](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-challenge-fall-2022):

> In this Fall Challenge, each user will take on the role of a lifetime, serving as captain of the Earth’s first faster-than-light starship. It’s your job to lead humanity into a new era of space exploration, and you’ll surely encounter some magnificent discoveries along the way — from beautiful distant worlds to mind-boggling cosmic phenomena. But to survive this long and arduous journey, you’ll need the help of IBM Quantum’s Qiskit Runtime service and the new primitives-based programming model that it enables.
