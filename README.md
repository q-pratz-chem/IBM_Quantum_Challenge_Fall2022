### Travel the cosmos with Qiskit Runtime

The nicely quoted problem statement for the challenge from the [IBM Blog](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-challenge-fall-2022):

> In this Fall Challenge, each user will take on the role of a lifetime, serving as captain of the Earth’s first faster-than-light starship. It’s your job to lead humanity into a new era of space exploration, and you’ll surely encounter some magnificent discoveries along the way — from beautiful distant worlds to mind-boggling cosmic phenomena. But to survive this long and arduous journey, you’ll need the help of IBM Quantum’s Qiskit Runtime service and the new primitives-based programming model that it enables.


#### The challenge ahead   
**Lab 1: Qiskit Runtime and Primitives**   
**Lab 2: Quantum Machine Learning**   
**Lab 3: Quantum Optimization**    
**Lab 4: Quantum Chemistry**   
 
#### Error Suppression and Error Mitigation
- Routines  
  - Matrix-free Measurement Mitigation (M3)  
  - Dynamic Decoupling (DD)   
  - Twirled Readout Error eXtinction (T-REX)   
  - Digital Zero-noise Extrapolation (ZNE)   
  - Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC)  


To complete the challenge by coming up with the decode protocol to unscramble the message, finding optimal routes for own spaceship, calculating the reaction energies of interstellar molecules, and more, we need to build the computing journey on thoe Qiskit Runtime Primitives taking the advantage of Qiskit Runtime.
